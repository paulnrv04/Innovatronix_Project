            <h2>INNOVATRONIX</h2>
            <p>Innovatronix Inc has a diverse business portfolio - electronics design and assembly,
                photography and imaging, power electronics, electric vehicles and aquaculture farming.</p> <br>
        </div>

        <div class="section-header">
            <p>Established in 1991, Innovatronix Inc corporate office is located along Km 26, Sumulong 
                Highway, Sta. Cruz, Antipolo City, Philippines.</p> <br>
        </div>

        <div class="section-header">
            <p>In 1987, Ramon Castillo, a former senior engineer at Intel, left the manufacturing firm of computer components and integrated circuits, to put
                up Innovatronix, Inc. It is a fitting acronym for a company promising to engage in "innovative electronics" with Castillo as the engineer and one
                technician. For the first two years of operations, the company relied on projects from Intel, then to Motorola, Telefunken and later on to 
                companies in other industries, like manufacturing and packaging.
            </p> <br>
        </div>

        <div class="section-header">
            <p>The fact that Innovatronix was a small company and without a track record to boast did not become a hindrance to offer the products and
                services to industrial giants. These companies need Tronix services for productivity development. From this time on, sales picked up.
                Innovatronix has managed to increase its customer base through recommendations from its existing clients. Being the only Filipino firm
                experienced in making electronic displays, and Innovatronix was contracted to make the scoreboards for the Southeast Asian games held in
                Manila in November 1991. This big break became the starting point of bigger opportunities for Innovatronix.
            </p> <br>
        </div>

        <div class="section-header">
            <p>From scoreboards, Innovatronix's TRONIX brand on consumer electronic products was launched. Up to this date, Innovatronix had reached
                Filipino household with its Power-on-Delay (POD10), electronic ballasts, AVRs and ACT20 for window-type air conditioners. In 1997, when the
                Asian financial crisis came, Innovatronix was resilient by venturing into another business concept. This was due to the advent of digital cameras.
                Castillo, also a photography hobbyist, established the Tronix Imaging Centers in 1998. It started in Farmers Plaza, Ever Ortigas and Pavilion Mall
                in Biñan, Laguna offering digital imaging services plus retail of Tronix brand of consumer electronics.
            </p> <br>
        </div>

        <div class="section-header">
            <p>Over a few years, Innovatronix's network of outlets grew rapidly, covering the entire Metro Manila and nearby provinces. By 2006, Tronix
                Imaging Centers have scattered all over the country. It is one of the pioneers in the digital photo studio industry. Tronix Imaging Centers offer
                wide-range of digital imaging services.
            </p> <br>
        </div>

        <div class="section-header">
            <p>Also in 2006, Innovatronix Inc launched its own brand of photo equipment products. This product line is now exported to over 80 countries
                worldwide. While it used to export assembled electronic parts during the 1990s but using its own brand started the leap for Innovatronix to
                start doing business in the global marketplace, proving that a once-small Filipino enterprise can rise up and win its own challenges.
            </p> <br>
        </div>

        <div class="section-header">
            <p>In 2010, after years of continuous growth, Innovatronix Inc moved to its new office and manufacturing facility along Sumulong Highway,
                Antipolo City. The 3-storey building on a 50,000 sq ft lot is now housing its retail and export business units, product research & engineering and 
                administrative offices.
            </p> <br>
        </div>

        <div class="section-header">
            <p>In 2012, after years of R&D on Aquaculture Farming, Innovatronix started operations on its Aquaculture Business Unit - growing out shrimps.
                Initially intended for local market supplying the country's largest seafood distributors and dealers, it aims to export freshly chilled shrimps later
                on. The Aquaculture Farm is located in Jala-jala Rizal and sits on a 1.6 ha lot, consisting of three (3) greenhouses. This facility has an expected
                capacity of 700 tonnes a year. For more information, click here.

        <div class="section-header">
            <p>The company still carries products it started to offer, only complex in terms of design and technology. Truly, as the company grows, it still lives
                on with its name; continuing on innovating and providing better ideas.
